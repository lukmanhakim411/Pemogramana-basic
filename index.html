<h2 id="football"> Football</h2>

<p>Football is a sport that I have loved for as long as I can remember. As a child, I was always playing football in the park with my friends, and it quickly became one of my favorite sports to watch on television. Since then, my passion for the game has only grown stronger. </p>
<p>I am an avid fan of Chelsea Football Club and have been since they first began their rise to success back in 2004. From watching them win the Premier League title five times over the years, to seeing them compete in European competitions such as The Champions League - every moment spent watching Chelsea play has been nothing short of exhilarating! It's hard not to get swept up in all the excitement and energy surrounding each match day when you are a fan of such a successful team.</p>
<p>The sheer excitement I feel when my favorite club is playing never fails to amaze me. From the moment I wake up and start preparing for the match, until it's time to cheer them on from the stands or from home - watching Chelsea play has become an integral part of my life. It's something that brings me great joy and happiness, no matter what else may be going on in my life at any given time. </p>
<p>What I love most about being a Chelsea fan is how dedicated and passionate our supporters are around the world; we all have one common goal, which is to see our beloved Blues bring home more trophies! We live and breathe football here at Stamford Bridge; it's an honor to be a part of such an amazing family. </p>
<p>I love football and I will continue to do so for the rest of my life. Watching Chelsea play has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.</p>

<p>
    <q> absolutely adore reading; it's one of my favorite pastimes! </q></p>
<p>Reading is one of my favorite pastimes. I love being able to escape into a different world and explore different characters, settings, and themes. Reading books can take me on an adventure without ever leaving the comfort of my own home. It's an incredibly rewarding experience that can provide hours of entertainment.</p>
<p>I also find reading to be very calming and relaxing. After a long day at work or school, it's nice to curl up with a good book and just get lost in its pages for a while. With so many genres available nowadays, there is always something new to discover! From fantasy novels to non-fiction works about history or science, the possibilities are endless when it comes to finding something interesting and entertaining to read. </p>

<img src="assets/image/IT.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="Coding screen" width="400px"> <img src="assets/image/IT 2.jpg" class="featured-image" alt="Coding screen" width="400px">
<p>I absolutely love IT! Even though I'm an entry level student, I find the subject fascinating and challenging. It's amazing how much technology has advanced in recent years and it's exciting to be a part of that progress.</p>
<p>The best thing about IT is the potential for creativity. Whether you're coding a new website or developing a database, there are endless possibilities when it comes to creating something new and innovative. Plus, with all of the different tools available now, like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, it's incredibly cool to see what can be done with just a few lines of code! </p>
<p>Another great thing about IT is that there is always more to learn. Every day brings something new; whether its hardware developments or software advancements.</p>

<h2 id="English"> English language</h3>
<img src="assets/image/english.JPG" class="featured-image" alt="my photo" width="400px">
<p>English has always been a passion of mine. As a student of English Literature, I have come to appreciate the power and beauty of the language in ways that few can comprehend. From its rich history and literature to its vast array of dialects and accents, English is an incredibly diverse language with something for everyone.</p>
<p>The study of English Literature allows me to explore all aspects of the language including its historical development, literary conventions, and influential works from authors spanning centuries. In addition to learning about these topics in great detail, I am also able to develop my own writing skills by exploring how different writers express themselves through their words. This provides me with invaluable insight into how I can craft my own stories or poems as well as develop better communication skills overall.</p>
